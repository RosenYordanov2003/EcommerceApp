# Ecommerce Application
## About
### The application design is custom created from me and is fully responsive for all devices. From 280px width to 1920px width.
The application represents ecommerce app where users can buy products (clothes, shoes). Every user has own user-cart and list of his favorite products.
## The application has 2 roles:
